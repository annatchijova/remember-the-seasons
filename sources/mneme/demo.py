"""
MNEME — Demo harness: one poisoned-RAG incident, end to end, narrated.

    python3 demo.py

Zero dependencies beyond Python 3.10+; the field lives in SQLite
:memory: and the bundles in a temp directory. Every step is the public
API doing what an operator would do, in the order an incident actually
unfolds:

  0. an authority ledger is bootstrapped and capabilities are granted:
     every mutation below carries two separable proofs, integrity and
     authority — and one READ, the counterfactual, is gated too;
  1. a compromised pipeline plants a poisoned memory and inflates a
     legitimate one;
  2. recall shows the field's own defences (inhibition, the rescue
     rule) and their limit — the poison is servable;
  3. the actor is quarantined: one sealed sweep flags everything it
     touched;
  4. recall again: the custody gate withholds the flagged memories and
     the receipt counts them — and the quarantined actor discovers the
     containment is prospective too: it can no longer write at all;
  5. the false positive is rehabilitated by audited event, the blast
     radius is reconstructed, and the counterfactual measures what the
     poison actually DID rather than asserting it was handled;
  6. the whole field ships as a sealed bundle, verified by the
     standalone auditor file; a tampered copy is caught; a partial
     export declares — not hides — the sweep evidence it cannot carry.
