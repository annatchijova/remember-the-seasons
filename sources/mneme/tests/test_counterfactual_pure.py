"""
MNEME — counterfactual non-interference tests. SQLite :memory: only.

The claim under test is the strongest one MNEME makes, so it gets the
most adversarial reading:

    "Given this sealed state, removing the tainted memories does not
     change the decision except in these explicitly enumerated outputs."

What must hold for that to mean anything:
  - the measurement changes nothing it measures (no writes, no status
    moved, byte-identical field before and after);
  - it is reproducible (same state, same query -> same seal, always);
  - it detects interference when interference exists, in each of the
    forms an analyst cares about: dropped, entered, reranked, rescored,
    a claim flipped, a recorded decision's input removed;
  - it reports NON-INTERFERENCE only when the delta is genuinely empty,
    never as a default;
  - a counterfactual receipt can never be laundered into evidence about
    the real field.
