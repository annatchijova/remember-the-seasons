"""
MNEME — epistemic claims and n-ary contradiction. SQLite :memory: only.

The conflation these tests hold the implementation apart from: a memory
is a CONTAINER, a claim is a PROPOSITION, and the field's belief is
NEITHER — it is derived from both, every time it is asked.

Four sentences that used to be one, each with its own test:
  "this text was stored"            a memory and its custody chain
  "this actor asserts P"            a claim chain, with its own genesis
  "two artifacts support P"         evidence links, each an audited event
  "MNEME holds P"                   a standing, recomputed and never stored

And the n-ary part: `A contradicts B` is too poor for a date that is one
of three candidates. A set is a CONSTRAINT, resolution is an operation
over the whole hypothesis space, and a resolution that leaves its own
constraint violated is refused.
