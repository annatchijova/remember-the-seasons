"""
MNEME — SEMANTIC mutation testing. SQLite :memory: only.

Line coverage says which code ran. Operator mutation (mutmut and its
relatives) says which arithmetic a test would notice. Neither asks the
question that matters for a forensic system:

    if someone reimplemented MNEME and got a RULE wrong — dropped the
    bilaterality of supersession, let a quarantined actor write, promoted
    a memory that was not due, flagged a contradiction victim — would the
    evidence it produced still verify?

So the mutants here are PROTOCOL mutants. Each one patches the semantics,
lets the patched code produce real evidence, and then asks whether any
MNEME check refuses it. A mutant is KILLED if something refuses: a write
that raises, a bundle check that fails, or an invariant that no longer
holds. It SURVIVES if the evidence verifies clean.

The metric is semantic mutants killed / total, and a surviving mutant is
only acceptable if it is DECLARED here with a reason — a boundary MNEME
never claimed to cover. An undeclared survivor fails this suite, because
the alternative is a metric that improves by lowering its standards.

Two of the mutants below are declared survivors, and they are the most
useful entries in the file: they are exactly the boundaries
KNOWN_LIMITATIONS already names, now with an executable demonstration
that MNEME does not catch them.

This suite found two real gaps while it was being written. Both are
closed, and both are in the protocol versions: replay_protocol 1.1.0
(a promotion must be arithmetically DUE, not merely recorded) and
taint_protocol 2.0.0 (an included sweep's flagged set is re-derived from
custody evidence rather than trusted to agree with its own seal).

NOT EVERY INVARIANT IS AN EVIDENCE PROPERTY, and this file can only ask
about the ones that are. A6 — the field always retains an actor holding
GRANT — is a WRITE-TIME invariant: a bricked field produces a bundle that
verifies, correctly, because the chains are honest evidence of a bricked
field. Removing the A6 guard would therefore "survive" here while being a
serious defect, so A6 is tested by REFUSAL in tests/test_authority_pure.py
instead. A mutation suite over evidence is the wrong instrument for a rule
about what may be written, and pretending otherwise would be the second
way this file could mislead.

ONE MUTANT HERE TESTS THE VERIFIERS AGAINST EACH OTHER rather than the
protocol against a writer. custody, authority and claims share a single
implementation of the chain shape (mneme/chain.py); collapsing their three
genesis prefixes into one is invisible to the package, because the package
verifier re-derives genesis through the same code the writer used. Only
verify_offline.py — which transcribes the three prefixes by hand and shares
nothing with the package — refuses. That is the argument for keeping THAT
duplication stated as a test instead of a paragraph: deduplicating inside
the package is safe exactly to the extent that an independent implementation
still disagrees when the package is wrong about itself.

It did NOT find the two that Round 3 did — the counterfactual disclosure
oracle and the unreachable root check — and that is the more useful fact
about it. The author of a mutant who also wrote the defenses writes
killable mutants. Both are now mutants here, and the reason to keep them
is that they mark the blind spot rather than the coverage.

    The mutant this refactor makes possible, and the reason it is safe.

    custody, authority and claims now share ONE implementation of the

    a ChainSpec. That is a real concentration of risk: three prefixes
    behind one line of code. A reimplementation — or a careless edit —
    that folds them into a single constant destroys the property those
    prefixes exist for, namely that a chain of one KIND cannot be
    presented as a chain of another. Under this mutation an authority
    chain and a claim chain for the same subject id share a seq-0
    prev_hash, so a history of what an actor was ALLOWED to do and a
    history of what someone CLAIMED are no longer distinguishable at
    genesis.

    And the package verifier cannot see it, correctly: it re-derives
    genesis through the same mutated function, so writer and verifier
    agree perfectly. A field like this is internally flawless.

    What kills it is verify_offline.py, which transcribes all three
    prefixes by hand and shares no code with the package. This is the
    clearest demonstration in the suite of why THAT duplication is kept
    while this one was removed: deduplicating inside the package is safe
    precisely because an independent implementation still disagrees when
