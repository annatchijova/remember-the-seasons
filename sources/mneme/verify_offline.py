MNEME — Standalone offline bundle verifier. ZERO dependencies beyond a
Python 3.10+ interpreter. Send this file and a bundle to anyone; they
need nothing else — not the mneme package, not the database, not pip.

    python3 verify_offline.py bundle.json

Exit 0: every check passed. Exit 1: verdict is printed, one line per lie.

This file deliberately DUPLICATES the verification logic that also
lives in mneme/bundle.py and mneme/custody.py. Duplication is a cost we
pay for a property we value more: an auditor must be able to read ONE
short file and convince themselves of what "verified" means, with no
import graph to chase. The two implementations are held together by
tests/test_bundle_pure.py's agreement section, which runs both against
the same valid and tampered bundles and demands identical verdicts.
If you change the protocol, you change it in three places or the tests
scream. That is the design.

Checks (normative statement in mneme/bundle.py's header):
  B1  bundle seal recomputes
  B2  every custody chain: genesis bound to memory_id, dense seq,
      linkage, entry hashes recompute, closed vocabulary, canonical
      payload bytes, canonical UTC timestamps that never run backwards
  B3  content hashes to the seal in its STORED (birth) event; and where
      a memory declares embedding provenance, the vector shipped is the
      vector that record describes, under a quantization this verifier
      implements, with the model's input matching the content whenever
      the record claims no preprocessing. Memories that declare none are
      COUNTED and named on success: the boundary is trusted there, and
      that is stated rather than hidden
  B4  declared custody_status / field_state / confidence reproduce
      from replaying the chain's events; supersession lineage is
      bilateral when both parties travel in the bundle (a STORED
      "supersedes": X needs X's chain to name this memory back in a
      SUPERSEDED_BY event, and vice versa), and DECLARED in
      "excluded_lineage" when one party does not — absence stated, never
      implied, with the absent counterpart named on a passing verdict
  B5  sweep evidence — absence stated, never implied: no sweep_id in
      both "sweeps" and "excluded_sweeps"; every included sweep's
      flagged set matches its count and seal; an excluded sweep must
      be genuinely partial (strictly fewer flagged memories carried
      than its flagged_count); every sweep_id referenced by a
      TAINT_FLAGGED event appears in one of the two lists. Excluded
      sweeps' seals are NOT checked — exclusion is a declared claim
      the auditor sees (this verifier names them on success), not a
      verified one.
  B6  Merkle root over chain heads recomputes (leaves sorted by
      memory_id ASC, odd leaf promoted unpaired)
  B7  authority provenance: every authority chain verifies and replays;
      declared actor status reproduces from it; exactly one self-issued
      root grant conferring the whole vocabulary; NO AMPLIFICATION —
      every authority event's issuer held, IMMEDIATELY BEFORE that
      event, the capability the event required and (for a grant) every capability
      it conferred; and every custody event at or after the declared
      authority genesis names a grant that was active for its actor at
      that instant, conferred the capability its event type requires,
      and belonged to an actor not then quarantined. Events before the
      genesis — and every event in a field with no ledger at all — are
      UNAUTHORIZED BY DECLARATION: named on success, never passed as
      authorized.
  B8  causal provenance: carried receipts recompute from their own
      columns under the bundle's declared ranking semantics; every
      decision re-derives its seal, cites a receipt carried here, and
      claims only memories that receipt actually served; an included
      decision's used memories all travel and each names the decision
      back in a DECISION_USED_MEMORY event (bilateral, like lineage); an
      excluded decision must be genuinely partial; and no
      DECISION_USED_MEMORY event references a decision the bundle
      neither carries nor declares excluded.

  B0 comes last in this list and first in the code: a V2 bundle declares
      the VERSION of every semantics its checks depend on, and a
      verifier that meets a version it does not implement refuses rather
      than applying today's rules to yesterday's evidence.
