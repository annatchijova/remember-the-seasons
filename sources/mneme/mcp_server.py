"""
MNEME MCP Server
================
Exposes the MNEME per-memory chain-of-custody system as an MCP server,
so any MCP-capable agent (Claude, Claude Code, custom agents) can store,
recall, reinforce, quarantine, export bundles, and verify evidence
through the Model Context Protocol.

Design notes
------------
- FastMCP over stdio, same transport model as CRONOS, CORVUS, and
  raven-memory MCP servers.
- MNEME has no external dependencies (stdlib + SQLite only). This server
  adds only the `mcp` package.
- Every MNEME function takes a live cursor and never commits — the MCP
  server provides the cursor and commits after each tool call succeeds.
  A failing operation rolls back automatically (SQLite default behavior
  when a transaction is not committed).
- Embeddings: MNEME stores embeddings as quantized Decimal lists. For
  the MCP server, the caller passes text and the server generates a
  deterministic embedding (SHA-256-seeded, non-semantic) unless a real
  embedding provider is configured. This is honest: the deterministic
  provider declares is_semantic=False, so recall ranking is reproducible
  but not semantically meaningful — same discipline as STIGMERGY.
- Input sanitization follows VIGIA/CORVUS pattern.

    Custody-gated, exactly-ranked recall.

    Only memories with custody_status=CLEAN are servable. QUARANTINED,
    TAINT_FLAGGED, and SUPERSEDED memories are invisible — preserved as
    evidence but never served to the agent.

    Rankings are exact Fraction arithmetic: same DB state + same query =
    byte-identical results on any machine (no floats, no BLAS, no seed).

    Returns a sealed recall receipt (SHA-256 digest over the served set
    and exclusion counts) that proves what was served and what was withheld.

    Args:
        query: Text to search for (embedded deterministically).
        top_k: Maximum results (1-20).
        hops: BFS expansion depth (0=seed only, 2=default).
        as_of: Optional canonical UTC instant

            (not "withheld"), statuses are replayed rather than read from
            today's columns, and links created afterwards are not
            traversed. The forensic question this answers is "with what
            the agent legitimately had at that instant, what would it
            have retrieved?" — not "why does this look absurd today?".
        persist_receipt: Keep the receipt as evidence. Recall stays
            read-only by default — serving is not a state transition, and
            forcing a write into the hottest read path would invert that.
            Set this when the recall is about to inform a decision:

    memories change the agent's behaviour, and in exactly which outputs?

    Influence exposure: spend an exact rational budget outward from the
    tainted set and grade what it reaches.

    Transitive taint is real, and propagating it automatically is how one
    quarantine silences a whole field — resonance graphs are connected in
    practice. The answer is not to propagate more carefully but to stop
    equating contact with contamination:

      DIRECT_TAINT       evidence names this memory (a sweep flagged it,
                         or an analyst quarantined it).
      INFLUENCE_EXPOSED  a RESONANT path carries at least the floor of
                         influence to it, reported WITH its exact budget
                         ("1/2", "1/8") so "how exposed" is a number.
      CLEAN              neither.

    A RESONANT edge conveys half of whatever reaches its source; anything
    below the floor is dropped. Termination is structural, not a
    visited-set trick: influence strictly decreases per edge, so no path
    beyond the derived depth bound can contribute, and cycles are
    harmless. INHIBITORY edges convey nothing — being disagreed with by a
    poisoned memory is not being influenced by it.

    Writes nothing and flags nothing. INFLUENCE_EXPOSED is a finding for
    an analyst, never a custody status; quarantining on contact would
    make the response indistinguishable from the incident.

        memory_ids: Optional comma-separated hypothetical sources ("if
