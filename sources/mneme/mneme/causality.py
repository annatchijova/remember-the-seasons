MNEME — Causal closure: recall → decision → blast radius.

The gap this module closes was named in KNOWN_LIMITATIONS before it was
closed: a recall receipt proves what the agent was SHOWN, and nothing
proves what the agent DID with it. So MNEME could answer

    "why did the agent remember X?"

and could not answer the question an incident actually asks:

    "which DECISIONS were causally contaminated by X?"

A receipt is evidence about a read. A DECISION RECORD is evidence about
an act, and it is the agent's own explicit, authorized commitment:

    receipt_sha256    what the recall showed it (a persisted receipt,
                      itself replayable — receipt_protocol 2.0.0 records
                      the question as well as the answer)
    decision_sha256   what it produced, BY HASH. MNEME never sees the
                      artifact and will not pretend to: it commits to a
                      digest the agent supplies, so "this decision" is a
                      fixed object that cannot be quietly re-written
                      later, while its content stays outside the field.
    policy_version    under which rules. Two decisions from one receipt
                      under different policies are two different facts.
    used_memory_ids   which of the served memories the decision actually
                      consumed — a SUBSET of the receipt's served list,
                      checked at write and re-checked at verification.
                      "A receipt that references a memory it never
                      served" is precisely the lie this refuses.

BILATERAL, like contradiction and lineage. Each used memory's custody
chain gains a DECISION_USED_MEMORY event naming the decision, and the
decision names the memory back. Neither side can hide the link alone:
delete the decision row and the memory chains still accuse it; strip the
custody events and the decision's claim has no corroboration. Bundle
check B8 demands both directions.

WHY THIS IS NOT A RECALL SIDE EFFECT. Recall stays read-only (Invariant
M2's intent): serving is not a state transition, and writing a decision
event on every recall would convert the hottest read path into a write
path AND would record a decision that may never have been made. Using a
memory in a decision is a separate act, by a separate capability
(DECIDE), at a separate moment.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
BLAST RADIUS

`impact(cur, memory_id)` reconstructs, from evidence alone, everything
that depended on one memory — and grades it, because the alternative is
the failure mode KNOWN_LIMITATIONS already names: indiscriminate
transitive taint turns a connected graph into a self-inflicted denial of
service. Three levels, and the distinction between them is the point:

  DIRECT     Evidence says this memory was served or used. Persisted
             receipts whose served list contains it; decisions whose
             used_memory_ids contain it. Not inference — rows.

  DERIVED    Evidence says this could not be what it is without that
             memory: supersession successors (transitively), and
             memories whose STORED payload names a decision that is
             itself DIRECT or DERIVED (`derived_from_decision`). The
             agent declares that link when it stores; MNEME does not
             guess it.

             AND THE DECLARATION IS GRADED, because it is SELF-ASSERTED.
             Descent is the one relation MNEME does not make bilateral —
             the decision it descends from was written before the memory
             existed and cannot name it back — so an audit found that a
             `DECIDE` holder can make its own memory look like a victim
             of an honest one. The report therefore splits the level:
             `derived_memories` are those whose declaring actor IS the
             cited decision's actor (one actor's coherent account of its
             own work), and `derived_unattested` are those where a third
             party claims descent from someone ELSE's decision. The
             second is strictly weaker and says so rather than sitting
             silently in the strong bucket.

  POSSIBLE   Contact, not contamination. Memories co-served in the same
             recall as this one, and its RESONANT neighbours. These
             ranked alongside it or could have been amplified by it. The
             level exists so an analyst can SEE the perimeter without the
             system pretending contact is proof — POSSIBLE is reported,
             never acted on, and never a custody status.

The report is deterministic (every set sorted, every traversal ordered)
and sealed: two runs against the same state produce byte-identical
evidence, so "this was the blast radius" is a claim someone else can
recompute rather than a screenshot.

As everywhere: every function takes a live cursor and NEVER commits.
