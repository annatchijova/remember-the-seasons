MNEME — Actor quarantine and deterministic taint propagation.

The scenario this module exists for: you discover that a data source
(an ingestion pipeline, a scraping agent, a compromised colleague
account) was feeding poisoned content into your agent's memory. The
question is never "delete its memories" — under Invariant M4 nothing is
deleted, and deletion would also destroy the evidence. The question is:

    "Show me EVERYTHING this actor touched, flag all of it so recall
     stops serving it, seal the flagging itself so nobody can later
     dispute what was flagged — and make the whole operation
     reproducible from the audit trail alone."

Definition of "touched" (deliberately broad, documented, testable):
a memory is tainted by actor X if any event in its custody chain names
X as actor_id — EXCEPT CONTRADICTED_BY. Not just STORED — a poisoned
source that REINFORCED a legitimate memory inflated its confidence,
and that inflation is part of the incident. Analysts can REHABILITATE
false positives; the rehabilitation is itself an audited custody
event. Over-flagging with an audited reversal path is recoverable;
under-flagging is not.

The CONTRADICTED_BY carve-out is an explicit architecture decision,
not a softening. When X stores a memory that contradicts memory V, the
contradiction event lands on V's chain with X as its author — the one
event type through which an actor writes its identity onto an
ARBITRARY victim's chain. Counting it as "touched" hands an attacker a
lever: contradict every truth you want suppressed, and the day you are
quarantined, the sweep silences your victims for you — a validated
truth silenced by an unverified claim, the exact outcome the rescue
rule exists to refuse. Taint tracks INFLUENCE (events that created a
memory or raised its standing); being attacked by X is not influence
by X. The attacker's own contradicting memory is still flagged through
its STORED event, and the victim's chain still carries the
CONTRADICTED_BY evidence for any auditor to see.

Determinism: the flagged set is derived from the custody_chain table by
one SQL query with a total ORDER BY; the sweep seals
sha256(canonical_json({"memory_ids": sorted_ids})) so two replays of the
same database state produce byte-identical sweep evidence.

SCOPE, AND THE BOUND THAT MAKES IT SAFE. The sweep flags DIRECT taint
only: the actor appears in the chain. TRANSITIVE taint — memory A is
tainted and A's RESONANT links inflated B — is real, and automatic
propagation of it without a bound is how a quarantine becomes a
self-inflicted denial of service on your own memory, because resonance
graphs are connected in practice.

The answer is not to propagate less carelessly; it is to stop equating
contact with contamination. `influence_exposure()` at the foot of this
module spends an exact rational INFLUENCE BUDGET outward from the
tainted set and grades what it reaches: DIRECT_TAINT (evidence names
it), INFLUENCE_EXPOSED (a resonant path carries at least the floor of
influence to it, reported with its exact budget), CLEAN. It terminates
by construction rather than by a visited-set trick, it writes nothing,
and INFLUENCE_EXPOSED is deliberately NOT a custody status. The sweep
still flags only what it can demonstrate; exposure tells an analyst
where to look.

As everywhere: modules take a live cursor and NEVER commit (M2).

    hold QUARANTINE_ACTOR, and the quarantine now has TWO halves that
    land in the same transaction —

                     set is empty (Invariant A5). The actor cannot store
                     a fresh CLEAN memory, cannot reinforce a clean one,
                     cannot rehabilitate its own evidence.

    Before this, containment was retrospective only: the sweep flagged
    history while the compromised actor kept writing, and a second sweep
    was refused as a duplicate. Flagging the past while the present stays
    open is not containment.

    Step by step:

      1. actors.status -> QUARANTINED (idempotence: re-quarantining an
         already-quarantined actor is refused with our words — a second
         sweep for the same incident would double-write custody events
         and split the evidence across two sweep ids).
      2. every memory carrying an event by X whose type is not in
         NON_INFLUENCE_EVENTS, ordered by memory_id — the deterministic
         flagged set (see NON_INFLUENCE_EVENTS for why being contradicted
         by X, or cited by X's decision, is not being touched by X).
      3. For each: custody event TAINT_FLAGGED + custody_status update
         (only if currently CLEAN; QUARANTINED/SUPERSEDED memories keep
         their stronger status, but the custody event is still written —
         the chain records that the sweep saw them).
      4. taint_sweeps row sealing the sorted id list.
      5. Advisory: one-hop RESONANT neighbours of the flagged set that
         are NOT themselves flagged — reported, not flagged (see header).

# Influence budget — the principled bound KNOWN_LIMITATIONS asked for
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The limitation this answers, in its own words: transitive taint is real
# but unbounded, resonance graphs are connected in practice, and automatic
# propagation without a fixpoint bound turns one quarantine into a
# self-inflicted denial of service on the whole field. The note proposed
# hop-limit plus decay threshold. An influence BUDGET is the same idea made
# exact, and it is stronger in one specific way: the bound is not a
# parameter someone tuned until the output looked reasonable, it is a
# consequence of the arithmetic.
#
# THE RULE. Every directly tainted memory starts with influence 1. A
# RESONANT edge conveys INFLUENCE_TRANSFER of whatever reaches its source.
# A memory's exposure is the MAXIMUM over all paths reaching it — the
# strongest line of suspicion, not a sum, because summing lets a
# well-connected memory accumulate past 1 and turns "many weak contacts"
# into a number that looks like proof.
#
# TERMINATION IS STRUCTURAL, not a visited-set trick. Influence along any
# path is strictly decreasing by a factor of 1/2 per edge, and anything
# below EXPOSURE_FLOOR is dropped, so no path longer than
# MAX_INFLUENCE_DEPTH can contribute. Cycles are harmless: a second visit
# to a node necessarily arrives with strictly less influence and is
# discarded. The algorithm cannot fail to halt, for any graph.
#
# INHIBITORY EDGES CONVEY NOTHING. Exactly the CONTRADICTED_BY carve-out
# in this module's header, applied to the graph: being disagreed with by a
# poisoned memory is not being influenced by it. Counting inhibition as
# influence would hand an attacker the same lever — contradict everything
# you want suspected, then get yourself quarantined.
#
# THE GRAPH IS READ WITHOUT THE CUSTODY GATE, deliberately. Recall refuses
# to traverse a non-CLEAN node because it must not let a tainted memory
# perturb what is served TODAY. Exposure asks a historical question —
# what did this memory influence while it was trusted — and gating that
# traversal would hide precisely the paths an incident is about.
