RAVEN-MEMORY v1.1
Adaptive Memory Substrate for Agentic Systems
Track 1: MemoryAgent — Qwen Cloud Hackathon

Architecture:
- KDTree + k-NN graph for neighbourhood activation
- Ternary states: REINFORCED (×1.5), NEUTRAL (×1.0), FORGOTTEN (×0.0)
- Hop decay: score *= exp(-λ * hop_distance)
- STDP: LTP (potentiation) + LTD (depression) synaptic dynamics
- Ternary cell links: RESONANT / NEUTRAL / INHIBITORY
- Recency scoring with configurable half-life
- Stylometric fingerprinting for author verification
- Audit hash-chain for tamper-proof traceability
- SQLite persistence with lazy KDTree rebuild
