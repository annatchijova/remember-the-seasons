"""
raven.intervention — causal probes over the retrieval graph.

Runners built ON TOP of AdaptiveMemoryEngine.intervene(). Nothing here touches
the engine's internals: the primitive is read-only with respect to the field,
and these are just search strategies over which cells to silence.

Scope of the claim (docs/INTERVENTION_DESIGN.md §1): everything measured here is
**retrieval causal influence** — the effect of a silencing on RAVEN's own
deterministic recall. It says nothing about a downstream agent's answer, which
depends on a model this module never runs.

Two things make the search worth more than one-cell-at-a-time probing:

  suppress(A)      → no change
  suppress(B)      → no change
  suppress(A,B)    → X disappears        ⇒ redundant paths to X

  suppress(A)      → X disappears
  suppress(B)      → X disappears        ⇒ two necessary dependencies

and the invariant fuzzer, which points the same machinery at the rescue rule.

    Fault injection against:

        a validated truth cannot be silenced by an unverified claim

    The naive oracle ("a REINFORCED memory disappeared") is WRONG, and would
    report false violations. A suppression may legitimately remove a REINFORCED
    memory — by silencing the only path that reached it. The rescue rule
    promises protection against *inhibition by an unvalidated claim*, not
    topological immortality.

    So the falsifiable form is narrower: silencing only NON-REINFORCED cells,
    never the target's own cell, must never cause a REINFORCED memory to leave
    the result set **via the inhibition path**. Any other exit is legal and is
    recorded separately rather than counted as a violation.

    VACUITY, STATED HONESTLY (red-team finding RT-1): under the current engine
    semantics `violations` is unreachable, not merely unlikely — the rescue
    loop discards REINFORCED cells from `inhibited_cells` before any INHIBITED
    exclusion is written, so the exclusion path this fuzzer counts as a
    violation can never fire. What this fuzzer genuinely exercises is the
    legal-exit machinery (UNREACHABLE / STATE_FILTER / LAYER_FILTER /
    STYLOMETRY exits under random suppression). The violation branch is kept
    as a tripwire: if the rescue semantics ever change, this fuzzer is the
    first thing that should scream. Its discriminating power is pinned by a
    counterfactual test against a stubbed engine (tests/test_fuzz_oracle.py)
    that proves the wiring WOULD record a violation if an INHIBITED exit for a
    REINFORCED memory were ever produced.

    Returns the violations plus the legal exits, so a run that finds nothing
    still shows what it actually exercised.
