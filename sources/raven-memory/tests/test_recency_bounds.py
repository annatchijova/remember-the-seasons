"""
RAVEN-MEMORY — the recency term is bounded, including under clock skew.

Regression tests for a defect found by the intervention work's adversarial pass
(docs/INTERVENTION_DESIGN.md §13, finding B). The defect predates that work:
reproduced identically on e539df8 (= main).

    recency_bonus = RECENCY_WEIGHT · exp(−ln2 · age / RECENCY_HALFLIFE)

With `age < 0` — a last_activation in the future — the exponential GROWS
instead of decaying, without bound. The failure is not the eventual
OverflowError at roughly +2.8 years; it is everything before it, where the
engine keeps returning well-formed, serialisable, confidently wrong rankings.

These tests state the PROPERTY, deliberately not the numbers the buggy code
happens to produce:

    age_effective = max(0, now − last_activation)
    0 ≤ recency_bonus ≤ RECENCY_WEIGHT           for every possible timestamp
    a future timestamp scores exactly like `now`, never better

"Activity in the future" cannot mean "more recent than now": the most recent a
memory can be is now, and the term's ceiling is its value at age = 0.
