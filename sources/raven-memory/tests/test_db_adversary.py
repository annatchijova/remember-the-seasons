"""
RAVEN-MEMORY — adversary for a future DBWitness, written BEFORE the witness.

The point of the order: designing the canonicaliser first is how you fall in love
with the hash. These are concrete pairs of databases that a plausible "semantic
snapshot" calls EQUAL and that RAVEN distinguishes behaviourally. Each one is a
requirement DBWitness has to meet, expressed as a failing oracle for the naive
snapshot rather than as prose.

The promotion property they serve:

    DBWitness(A) == DBWitness(B)
      + same non-DB semantic state
      + same operation inputs
    ⇒ same DB-dependent observable behaviour

That cannot be proven by tests. Trying to falsify it is what forces the missing
causal state into the open, and it already has: three times here.

The dangerous direction is asymmetric. `DBWitness !=` with identical behaviour is
a conservative over-approximation. `DBWitness ==` with different behaviour is the
failure that makes a purity gate a lie.

Nothing here implements DBWitness.
