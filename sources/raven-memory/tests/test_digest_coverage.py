"""
RAVEN-MEMORY — what structural_digest() actually observes.

`test_probes_leave_no_trace_in_any_engine_attribute` currently proves

    nothing changed THAT structural_digest() CAN REPRESENT

and not

    nothing changed in the engine's structural state.

Both produce the same green, which is the problem. `_canon_value()` fails OPEN:
anything it does not recognise becomes `("opaque", type_name)` — a type label
with no content — and everything reachable only through that node disappears
from the comparison entirely.

This module makes the instrument confess before anyone improves it:

  * an inventory of the reachable state graph vs. what the digest encodes,
    with declared exclusions carrying written justifications, so a new blind
    spot appearing later fails instead of passing silently;
  * four KNOWN-BLINDNESS characterisation tests that assert the gate stays
    GREEN under mutations it cannot see.

The four are NOT properties. They are documentation of a defect, written as
executable assertions so the day the witness lands they must be INVERTED, not
deleted. Read them as "today this is invisible", never as "this is fine".

Deliberately NOT done here: no change to structural_digest(). Establishing what
the instrument can claim comes before changing what it does.
