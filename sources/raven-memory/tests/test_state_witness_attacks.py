RAVEN-MEMORY — StateWitness after the identity-boundary rebuild.

The adversarial round on the first version (0cf0cd1) landed three defects:

  1. interned value atoms polluted the identity graph — attaching ONE alias
     renamed 19 unrelated edges, because `1` inside a fresh dict IS the `1` in
     `_active_cells`;
  2. observation executed the observed object's code (`repr`, potentially
     `__eq__`);
  3. dict keys went through `repr()`, leaking heap addresses and hiding a second
     identity graph inside the edge labels.

All three were frozen there as green KNOWN_DEFECT characterisations. This file
is their INVERSION: each now asserts the corrected semantics, and the tests that
survived the attack unchanged are kept alongside so the two categories stay
distinguishable.

One limit is unchanged and still stated: S0 → S1 → S0 is out of reach for any
before/after comparison.
