"""
MNEME — causal closure tests. SQLite :memory: only; no external infra.

The question these tests hold the implementation to is not "why did the
agent remember X" — custody answered that already — but the one an
incident actually asks:

    which DECISIONS were causally contaminated by X, and can you prove
    the answer rather than assert it?

One test per way a causal claim can be a lie:
  - a decision citing a receipt nobody kept   -> no anchor, refused
  - a decision claiming an unserved memory    -> the subset check
  - a decision that used nothing              -> not a causal link
  - a decision by an actor lacking DECIDE     -> authority refuses
  - decision evidence edited after the fact   -> seal does not recompute
  - the custody half of the link deleted      -> Merkle head + B8
  - the decision half stripped from a bundle  -> bilaterality, other way
  - a partial export hiding a decision        -> declared, never implied
  - a 1.1.0 word inside a 1.0.0 bundle        -> versioned vocabulary

Plus the blast radius itself: DIRECT is rows, DERIVED is declared
descent, POSSIBLE is contact — and the three must not be confused,
because equating contact with contamination is how a quarantine becomes
a denial of service on your own field.
