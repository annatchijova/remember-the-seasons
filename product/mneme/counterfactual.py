"""
MNEME — Counterfactual contamination analysis. Non-interference, measured.

Containment normally ends with a sentence that sounds like a result and
is not one:

    "We found the poisoned memory and excluded it."

That says what was done. It does not say what it DID. The question an
incident review actually needs answered is the counterfactual one:

    Given this sealed state, does removing the tainted memories change
    the agent's behaviour — and if so, in exactly which outputs?

This module answers it as an arithmetic fact rather than a reassurance.
Two worlds over one field:

    W   the field under one hypothetical custody state
    W'  the field under another

    recall(W, q)  -> R
    recall(W', q) -> R'

and the exact, reproducible delta between them:

    removed_from_serving           in R, gone from R'
    entered_top_k                  in R', absent from R
    rank_changed                   in both, at different positions
    score_changed                  in both, at the same position,
                                   different exact score
    claim_outcome_changed          a topic whose winning claim flips
    decision_dependency_changed    recorded decisions whose evidence base
                                   the change removes

The first five are QUERY-SCOPED: they are about what this query returned.
The sixth is FIELD-WIDE — decisions whose evidence base moves, most of
which came from other queries entirely — and it is deliberately NOT
folded into the interference verdict. Merging them was the first version
of this code, and it made the finding the module exists for unreachable:
any memory that had ever informed a decision would have reported
interference on every query forever, including queries it could not
possibly touch. The two scopes are reported side by side, and the seal
covers both.

If the query-scoped delta is empty, the statement MNEME can make is
strong and unusual: *for this query, under this sealed state, the
tainted memories exerted no observable influence.* NON-INTERFERENCE,
proven for that query — not asserted, and not extrapolated to other
queries, which is the boundary this module is most careful about.

WHY THIS IS EXACT AND NOT A SAMPLE. Ranking is exact rational arithmetic
with a total tiebreak (ranking_protocol 1.0.0), so recall is a pure
function of (state, query, top_k, hops). Two worlds differing only in
custody status therefore differ in exactly the ways this delta lists,
every time, on any machine. A float ranking would have made the same
comparison a matter of opinion near ties — which is the practical reason
the exactness discipline was worth its cost.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE, stated plainly because the value of the claim
depends on the boundary:
  - It is per QUERY. "No interference on q" is not "no interference".
    The honest generalization is over a stated query set, and the delta
    seals the query it examined.
  - It compares RECALL outputs, not the agent's reasoning. If two
    different served sets would have produced the same decision anyway,
    that is a fact about the policy, not about MNEME.
  - decision_dependency_changed names decisions whose INPUT changes. It
    does not re-run them; MNEME never sees a decision's content, only
    its hash.

As everywhere: takes a live cursor, NEVER commits, and changes nothing.
The whole point is a measurement that could not have perturbed its own
subject.
