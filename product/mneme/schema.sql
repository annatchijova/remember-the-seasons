-- MNEME — Core Schema, Phase 1 (SQLite WAL)
-- =============================================================================
-- Portability note: this schema is written to port to CockroachDB with
-- mechanical changes only (TEXT->STRING, INTEGER->INT8, add DECIMAL(11,10)
-- for quantized columns, changefeeds for the taint sweeper). Every
-- discipline below is inherited from STIGMERGY's schema and holds in both
-- engines.
--
-- Invariants enforced or supported here (see custody.py header for M1–M5):
--   M1  memories.content is immutable — no UPDATE path exists in the app;
--       supersession is a new row + SUPERSEDED_BY custody event.
--   M2  every state-changing write must accompany a custody_chain row in
--       the same transaction. custody_chain.reason is NOT NULL — an
--       unreasoned custody event cannot exist.
--   M3  custody chains are per-memory, append-only, seq dense from 0.
--       PRIMARY KEY (memory_id, seq) makes forks a constraint violation.
--   M4  nothing is deleted. status transitions are audited states.
--       No FK declares ON DELETE anything: default RESTRICT means an
--       accidental DELETE fails loudly instead of cascading destruction.
--   M5  floats never decide. Confidence/trust stored as TEXT holding a
--       fixed-point decimal at canonical scale 10 (SQLite has no DECIMAL;
--       storing the canonical string preserves the exact bytes that were
--       hashed — REAL would round-trip through IEEE 754, which is the
--       exact failure mode this project exists to refuse).

-- makes a second root a constraint violation, not a race outcome.
--
-- It holds no authority of its own. It is a cache of "which chain carries the

-- governance — Invariant A6, as a CONSTRAINT instead of a promise.
--
-- A6 says the field always retains at least one ACTIVE actor holding GRANT:
-- a field nobody can ever authorize anything in, including its own repair,
-- is indistinguishable from a successful attack. The first implementation
-- checked it with a read inside revoke() and nowhere else, which left two
-- holes an audit found:
--
--   * QUARANTINE was not guarded at all. Quarantining the last GRANT holder
--     emptied governance silently, and a following self-revocation by the
--     responder left a field that could never grant, register, or reinstate
--     again — permanently bricked, by two individually legitimate acts.
--   * The revoke check was read-then-write. Two concurrent revokes each
--     skipping a different holder both pass; only SQLite's single-writer
--     lock serialised them, and an engine at READ COMMITTED would not.
--
-- One counter on one row answers both. The CHECK makes zero a constraint
-- violation; the conditional UPDATE (`WHERE holders > 1`) makes the
-- decrement atomic, because two transactions touching the SAME ROW
-- serialise on its lock under every engine worth porting to, rather than
-- relying on an isolation level a config flip can change.
--
-- It holds no authority. It is a cache of a fact the chains already carry,
-- like actors.status, and B7 re-derives governance from evidence — never
-- from here.
